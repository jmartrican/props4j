=======

A library for easily managing properties in your Java applications.  Just create a PropertyBean child class and annotate the fields that would like to retrieve from a property file.  The property file name will be the same as the PropertyBean class you created and the property fields in the property file will match the name of the fields in your PropertyBean class.  Allows for real-time updating of your property fields.  Retrieve an instance of your PropertyBean using a static PropertyBeanFactory class.
